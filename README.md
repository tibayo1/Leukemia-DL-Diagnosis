# Leukemia-DL-Diagnosis
This a project on Leukemia diagnosis which is an ofshoot from a project developed by sg_ai_medicine(A slack channel formed under the Bertelsman scholarship undertaking the Deep Learning Udacity course) For more enquires on the Deep Learning Course, Kindly check here (https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)

This is towards a direct implementation of the paper: Human-level recognition of blast cells in acute myeloid
leukemia with convolutional neural networks(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/564039v1.full.pdf)

Original Implementation can be found: https://codeocean.com/capsule/9068249/tree/v1

The major codes of this project was orginally created by Rasha(GitHub username: @gamesMum(https://github.com/gamesMum/Leukemia-Diagnostics)) 

Datasets where provide in via kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/lsaa2014/single-cell-morphological-dataset-of-leukocytes)
